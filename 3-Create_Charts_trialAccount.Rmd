# Note

This tutorial is intended for those users that have trial access to aWhere's API;
such access is limited to being able to retrive 6 months worth of historical daily
data.  If you are currently have greater account privlidges, you are encouraged to
reference the tutorial "3-Create_Charts_fullAccount.RMD" as it will cover 
functions/features of the R package that cannot be leveraged using a trial account

# Introduction

This document describes how to generate aWhere weather data charts for a 
given location and timespan. Current/forecasted weather data is pulled from 
the aWhere API along with long-term normals for that same time span. 
Displaying line plots for variables of interest such as maximum temperature 
and P/PET allows us to observe weather trends and how current conditions 
compare to the past. 

Weather variables for additional selected years of interest can also 
be added to these charts for further analysis and comparison between
years. This tutorial adds 2016 and 2017 data onto charts for 
Accumulated Precipitation, P/PET, and effective P/PET. 


# Setup

**Install / load R packages**  
 
Install required packages from aWhere and CRAN (the official 
repository of R code).  If an error is encountered with the installation of these
packages below, a script is provided that will explicitly bypass normal R procedures
and install all necessary depencies in an automated fashion.  To use run 
```source('0-completeInstall_aWhereDepencies.R')``` and then run 
```completeInstall_aWhereDepencies(whichPackage_aWhere = ???)``` and replace ???
with ```'aWhereAPI','aWhereCharts', or 'all'``` depending on what you would like to
make use of
 
```{r install_packages}
# install CRAN packages
list.of.packages.CRAN = c("devtools")

new.packages.CRAN = list.of.packages.CRAN[!(list.of.packages.CRAN %in% 
                                              installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages.CRAN)) install.packages(new.packages.CRAN)


# install aWhere code packages
list.of.packages.Github = c("aWhereAPI", "aWhereCharts")

new.packages.Github = list.of.packages.Github[!(list.of.packages.Github %in% 
                                                  installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages.Github) > 0) {
  for (x in 1:length(new.packages.Github)) {
    if (new.packages.Github[x] == 'aWhereAPI') {
      devtools::install_github("aWhereAPI/aWhere-R-Library")
    } else if (new.packages.Github[x] == 'aWhereCharts') {
      devtools::install_github("aWhereAPI/aWhere-R-Charts")
    }
  }
} 
```

\newpage

Load the R packages that contain functions used in this script.

```{r load_packages}
# load packages 
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(curl)
library(zoo)
library(knitr)
library(aWhereAPI)
library(aWhereCharts)
```

**Define paths, input files, and parameters**  
 
Define your working directory. This is the place on your computer where your
input files are located for this tutorial, and it is also where the output 
files will be written. Instead of typing out the entire path to every file 
that we need (“absolute” paths), you can just use their filenames or 
locations within this working directory (“relative” paths) since we are 
setting this working directory as our starting point for the rest of the 
tutorial.

**NOTE**
*For this tutorial and ease of use for learning, all files will be written*
*to the directory where this file is run from.  An example of how one would set the*
*working directory is below for reference*

```{r set_up_working_dir, eval = FALSE}
#working directory - where input files are located and outputs will be saved.
working.dir <- c('~/aWhere/') 

# set the working directory
setwd(working.dir)
```
With R, it is also necessary to create the directory structure you will write data
files too beforehand.  If one fails to do this, an error will be thrown when the
data files are written

```{r createDirectoryStructure}
# create necessary output directories
dir.create(path = 'outputCSVs/',showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
dir.create(path = 'figures/',showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
```

Use the *source* function to load functions within .R files on your local
machine. For this tutorial, the *WriteJpeg* and *ClipValues* functions are
utilized within the "0-supporting_functions.R" file. 
There is a zero in the beginning of this filename so it appears at the top 
when files are sorted alphabetically.
 
```{r load_local_functions}
# load external R functions in local file
source(paste0(working.dir, "0-supporting_functions.R"))
```
 
To pull data from the aWhere API, you’ll need a Consumer Key and Secret, 
like a username and password. Put these in a text file with the following 
format: line 1 is the Consumer Key, line 2 is the Consumer Secret, and 
line 3 is a blank line. Set the `credentials.file` variable equal to the 
name of this text file. Place your credentials file in your working directory.

```{r awhere_credentials}
# filename containing your aWhere credientials (key and secret),
credentials.file <- paste0(working.dir,'credentials.txt')

# load the aWhere API credentials file 
aWhereAPI::load_credentials(credentials.file) 
```

What location do you want to produce weather data charts for? 
 
Specify the latitude and longitude, along with a name describing 
the place. This name will be used for the chart names and output 
file names.

```{r}
# latitude, longitude, and name of location 
lat <- 8.45
lon <- 80.4
location.name <- paste("Ana") 
```

\newpage

What timespan to you want to acquire weather data for? Specify the years 
and dates here. Years is a vector with the starting year in position 1 
and the ending year in position 2, for the long-term analysis.
 
The starting and ending days should have the format “YYYY-MM-DD” and 
should not exceed a period greater than 365 days. If you want the 
ending date to be n days from now (including some forecasted weather data), 
add or subtract n to the current date (which can be acquired using the 
*Sys.Date()* function). In the code below, when n = 7, the end date is 
seven days from now.

```{r data_timespan}
# starting and ending years and days for the time series. each is a vector with 
# the starting value in position 1 and the ending value in position 2. 
years <- c(2010, 2017)

#starting and ending days with format "YYYY-MM-DD"
day.start <- "2018-08-01"

#day.end <- "2018-03-08" # specific date
day.end <- as.character(Sys.Date() + 7) # today plus n
day.end <- as.character(Sys.Date() + 6) # today plus n

# combine the days into a single vector 
days <- c(day.start, day.end)
```

Some of the charts will require additional parameters. For instance, 
effective precipitation is calculated using a threshold 
(`eP` in the code below). Rolling average calculations require a window 
size or number of days to average over (`roll.avg` in the code below).

```{r additional_chart_parameters}
# effective precip amount for consistency across plots
eP <- 30    

# size of rolling average window for consistency across plots
roll.avg <- 30
```

# Processing Steps 

Some of the charts require rolling average calculations.
When the `roll.avg` variable is set to 30, this means that the first data 
point of the rolling average calculation does not start until 30 days after
the specified start date! To avoid having 30 days of no data in our
rolling average charts, let's adjust the start date to be 30 days earlier 
for the rolling average calculation.

```{r roll_avg_start_date}
# adjust the start date to be "roll.avg" days earlier
day.start.extended <- as.character(as.Date(day.start) - roll.avg)

# substitute this earlier date into the "days" vector for pulling data
days[1] <- day.start.extended
```


The duration for our time range cannot exceed 365 days. 
Let’s make sure our day range is an acceptable length.

```{r check_duration}
# check if time range is more than 365 days
duration <- as.Date(days[2]) - as.Date(days[1])

if(duration > 365) { 
  print ("Period too long")
}
```


**Pull the aWhere weather data for the specified location and timespan.**

The R function that we use to pull the data is *generateaWhereDataset*, 
which comes from the *aWhereCharts* R package. It’s good practice to 
specify which package each function is from, since multiple packages may 
have different functions with the same name. The syntax for doing this is 
to use two colons between the package and function names, 
like this: `package::function()`.

```{r pull_weather_data}
# pull the datasets for the specified location and time period   
weather.df <- aWhereCharts::generateaWhereDataset(lat = lat, lon = lon, 
                                                  day_start = days[1], 
                                                  day_end = days[2], 
                                                  year_start = years[1], 
                                                  year_end = years[2])
```

Let’s take a look at the weather data using the head function from 
the utils R package.

```{r check_weather_data}
# select the first five columns of the data frame using [,1:5]
# and show the first 10 rows using the "n" argument
utils::head(weather.df[,1:5], n = 10)
```

The variables of interest include accumulated precipitation, P/PET, PET 
and precipitation (to calculate effective precipitation). They are combined
with the rest of the weather data and written to a .csv file for later 
analysis. 

Let's take a look at the last few columns of the weather data frame.
We will see the additional selected year data that was obtained in the 
loop above, and what the column names look like.

```{r results=TRUE}
# reorder the columns in the data frame
weather.df <- weather.df %>% 
              dplyr::select(day, date, latitude, longitude, everything())

# look at the last few columns of the weather data frame. 
utils::head(weather.df[,(ncol(weather.df)-2):(ncol(weather.df))], n = 6)
```

**Write weather data to .csv file**  

Write the weather data to a .csv file for further analysis. 
Use the latitude, longitude, date range, and year range in the 
filename so future-you will know exactly what’s inside this file.

```{r write_csv}
# write forecast to .csv file 
utils::write.csv(weather.df, 
                 file = paste0('outputCSVs/',
                              paste(location.name, 
                              paste(days, collapse="_"),
                              paste(years, collapse="_"),
                              ".csv", sep="_")))

# since the rolling averages have already been calculated and the 
# weather data extending out to an earlier start date (30 days in this case)
# has been saved to file, let's filter our weather dataframe down to span
# the original date range for chart creation. 
weather.df.extended <- weather.df

weather.df <- weather.df %>% 
  dplyr::filter(as.Date(date) >= day.start)

```

# Create charts

Within the aWhereCharts package, there are two functions used here to create
time series charts. 

(1) *generateaWhereChart* - makes line plots comparing the current and long-term 
normals for each variable.
 
(2) *generateaWhereStdDevChart* - plots aWhere weather data with one standard 
deviation's shading above and below the long-term normalline. This function 
is meant to help users understand whether the current weather conditions are
significantly outside the norm.  

Plots with standard deviation are named with "1" at the end of the variable,
and those without standard deviation are named with "2". 


## Create chart: maximum temperature with standard deviation

Contruct the title for this chart using the variable name, location name, 
and the latitude/longitude.

```{r chart_title}
# create a variable containing the lat and lon, for plot titles
lat.lon <- paste0("(", lat, ", ", lon, ")") 

# construct title
max.temp.1.title <- paste0(location.name, "_Maximum Temp w StdDev")
```

Generate the plot using the *generateaWhereStdDevChart* function from the 
*aWhereCharts* package. 

```{r chart_max_temp}
# generate the plot 
max.temp.1 <- aWhereCharts::generateaWhereStdDevChart(data = weather.df, 
                                              variable = "maxTemp", 
                                              title = paste0(max.temp.1.title,
                                                              lat.lon))
```

To display the plot, use the plot object name.

```{r display_max_temp_chart, eval=FALSE}
# display the plot
max.temp.1
```

In the following sections, these same steps are performed for a series of 
other variables in the aWhere weather data set. 

## Minimum temperature with standard deviation 

```{r chart_min_temp, results=TRUE}
min.temp.1.title <- paste0(location.name, "_Minimum Temp w StdDev")

min.temp.1 <- aWhereCharts::generateaWhereStdDevChart(weather.df, 
                                              "minTemp", 
                                              title = paste0(min.temp.1.title,
                                                              lat.lon))
```

## Potential evapotranspiration (PET) with standard deviation 

```{r chart_pet_stddev}
pet.1.title <- paste0(location.name, "_PET w StdDev")

pet.1 <- aWhereCharts::generateaWhereStdDevChart(weather.df, 
                                                 "pet", 
                                                 title = paste0(pet.1.title,
                                                                lat.lon))
```

## Daily precipitation with standard deviation 

```{r chart_precip_stddev}
precip.1.title <- paste0(location.name, "_Daily Precipitation w StdDev")

precip.1 <- aWhereCharts::generateaWhereStdDevChart(weather.df, 
                                              "precipitation",  
                                              title = paste0(precip.1.title,
                                                              lat.lon))
```

## Daily precipitation without standard deviation 

```{r chart_precip}
precip.2.title <- paste0(location.name, "_Daily Precipitation")

precip.2 <- aWhereCharts::generateaWhereChart(weather.df,
                                              "precipitation",    
                                              title = paste0(precip.2.title,
                                                             lat.lon))
```

## Accumulated Precipitation with StdDev but no Effective Precipitation 

```{r chart_acc_precip_stddev}
no.eprecip.1.title <- paste0(location.name, 
                             "_Accumulated Precipitation w StdDev")

no.eprecip.1 <- aWhereCharts::generateaWhereStdDevChart(weather.df, 
                                            "accumulatedPrecipitation",
